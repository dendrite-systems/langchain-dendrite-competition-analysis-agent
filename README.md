***

This example repo contains a simple [LangGraph agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) AI agent that can help us detect competitors by using a variety of websites with the [Dendrite Browser SDK](https://github.com/dendrite-systems/dendrite-python-sdk).

<br /><br />
## Overview/Features
Repo contains:
- Langgraph Agent
- Streamlit UI
- Tool to extract and read about the latest posts on
  - Product Hunt
  - Hacker News
- Tool to log into Outlook and send emails

<br /><br />
## Prerequisites

To run this yourself locally, you'll need the following:

- Python v. 3.9+
- An OpenAI API key
- A free [Dendrite API key](https://dendrite.systems/create-account)
- The [Dendrite Vault Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dendrite-vault/faflkoombjlhkgieldilpijjnblgabnn) if you want to authenticate your agent to use your email.

Pro tip:
- [Install Poetry package manager](https://python-poetry.org/)

<br /><br />
## Dendrite Example Snippet

This is how easy it is to authenticate and send an email with Dendrite:

```python
@tool
async def send_email(email_address: str, subject: str, body: str):
    """This tool sends an email to the provided email address with the provided subject and body. Don't use markdown in the body."""
    async with AsyncDendrite(auth="outlook.live.com") as client:
        await client.goto("https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/")
        await client.click("the new email button")
        await client.fill_fields(
            {"to_field": email_address, "subject_field": subject, "body_field": body}
        )
        await client.click("the send email button")

```

<br /><br />
## Getting Started

1. **Download this repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dendrite-systems/langchain-dendrite-example.git
    ```
    ```bash
    cd langchain-dendrite-example
    ```

2. **Install packages** – Don't forget `dendrite install` since this installs the browser binaries

    ```bash
    # with poetry
    poetry install && poetry run dendrite install
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # with pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt && dendrite install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** – Get a free Dendrite API key [here](https://dendrite.systems/create-account).

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-Cs...
    DENDRITE_API_KEY=sk_4b0...
    ```

4. **Run the project:**
    
    ```bash
    # with poetry
    poetry run streamlit run agent.py
    ```
    ```bash
    # with pip
    streamlit run agent.py
    ```

5. **Try it out**, try sending the message:
   ```bash
   Hi, I'm building an AI tool called FooBar. Please find any new potential competitors and summarise them.
   ```

   To send emails, your agent needs to be authorized to use your Outlook account first. Here's how:
   
   1. Install the [Dendrite Vault Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dendrite-vault/faflkoombjlhkgieldilpijjnblgabnn)
   2. Log into Outlook in your browser
   3. Open the Dendrite vault extension
   4. Press "Authenticate on outlook.com"

   You should now be able to prompt the following:
   
   ```bash
   Hi, I'm building an AI tool called FooBar. Please find any new potential competitors and summarise them. Send the summaries to me via [enter email here].
   ```

<br /><br />
## Why is Dendrite so slow the first time I run a tool, and then so fast?

It's because the first time you call `client.extract("get all the product hunt posts")` our coding agents need to generate a script to fetch the products from the HTML.

The next time you call the same prompt (and the website structure hasn't changed), the same script will be re-used – instantly returning the data.

(I'd personally love to see chainlit added, I don't have time to add it now though!)
